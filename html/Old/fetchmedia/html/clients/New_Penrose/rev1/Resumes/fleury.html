          <h1>Thomas Fleury
            <br />
            Managing Director of Land Acquisitions and Development          </h1>
          <p>Mr. Fleury is responsible for acquisition of residential, multi-family, commercial and retail properties in the
            Washington D.C. market for the Penrose Group portfolio. His responsibilities include identification, financial
            analysis, due diligence, financing and closing. Mr. Fleury also serves as the primary agent for PEN*STAR Land
            Partners, a venture formed between The Penrose Group and Starwood Land Ventures to acquire residential and
            mixed use projects that can be purchased at a basis that allows for a “buy and hold” until the residential market
            recovers. Mr. Fleury has held senior management positions at the Van Metre Companies, Penzance Management
            Companies and the West*Group. He is a graduate of Texas State University and has many professional affiliations
            including appointment to the Commonwealth of Virginia Board of Housing and Community Development by both
            Governor Mark Warner and Governor Thomas Kaine.</p>
