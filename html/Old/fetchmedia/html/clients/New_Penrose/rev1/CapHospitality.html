          <h1>Capital Hospitality Group</h1>
          <p><em>Capital Hospitality Group (CHG)</em> was formed in 1998 for the purpose of developing and
            acquiring properties that are located in urban markets or other locations that because of scarcity of land or zoning
            restrictions have limited opportunities for future development. Previously, the two principals of CHG worked together
            at StudioPLUS hotels to launch an aggressive growth plan that included doubling the number of hotels in the chain in
            fourteen months. CHG will also selectively develop new hotels where the location provides significant barriers to
            entry. CHG has the resources and experience to support itâ€™s strategy to act as manager/operator of hotels and to
            provide management services. Each of the principals of CHG have more than twenty-five years of experience in all
          aspects of the hospitality industry including finance and development.</p>
