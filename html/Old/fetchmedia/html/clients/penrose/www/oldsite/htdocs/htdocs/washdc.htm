<p></font><font face="MS Sans Serif"><b><u>Washington, D.C. Metropolitan Area</u></b></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is a
4,000 square-mile region consisting of the District of Columbia; the Virginia counties of
Loudoun, Fairfax, Arlington, Prince William, and Stafford; the Virginia cities of Fairfax,
Falls Church, Manassas, Manassas Park, and Alexandria; and the Maryland counties of
Calvert, Charles, Frederick, Montgomery, and Prince George&#146;s. The home of our
nation&#146;s capital and the country&#146;s most highly educated work-force, Washington
D.C. is also a strategic East Coast location linking national and international markets
via an excellent transportation network, offering a balance of private sector and
government organizations. The area is one of the most consistent regions in the country in
terms of economic strength, stability, and continuous growth. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is
the fifth largest metropolitan statistical area in the United States, with a population of
over four million. According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the Washington, D.C.
SMSA is the country&#146;s fourth largest employment market with over two million jobs.
Historically dependent on the Federal Government, the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area
economy has become broadly diversified in the past 25 years. Today, the Federal Government
accounts for less than 17% of the area&#146;s employment. Although not the largest
employer, the Federal Government does help to stabilize the area&#146;s&#146;s economy,
with direct employment and the procurement of goods and services for the local area.
Despite defense and other federal employment cutbacks, federal procurement in the
Washington, D.C. area have grown steadily over the past five years resulting in
substantial private sector employment growth. As can be illustrated by the fact that of
every federal procurement dollar that is spent nationally, over 50 cents is spent in the
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The public sector in the Washington, D.C.
area is more than balanced by a substantial and diverse private sector. This diversity is
illustrated by the types of major corporations headquartered in the area, including Mobil
Oil, Marriott International/Host Marriott, General Dynamics, MCI, Gannett, Mars, America
Online, US Airways, and Lockheed/Martin, as well as significant financial institutions
such as the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Inter-American Development Bank,
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae. In fact, virtually all of the Fortune 500
companies have a presence in the area. In addition, a substantial percentage of the
private sector is comprised of industry segments that have excellent potential for future
growth. These include telecommunications, computer software and systems integration,
internet services, biotechnology, health related services, finance, industry associations,
and professional services. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The metropolitan area has the best educated
work force in the nation. <strong>When compared to other major markets, Washington ranks
first in the nation, with the highest percentage of professional and technical employment
categories, highest income levels, and the highest percentage of women in the work force.</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">This healthy economic diversification and
strong job growth has resulted in well over 250 million square feet of office space that
has doubled in size in the past fifteen years and continues to grow. The metropolitan area
possesses one of the lowest office vacancy rates in the country.&nbsp; In the recent real
estate downturn, the issue for many area was negative demand; the problem in Washington
was oversupply. Throughout the 1990-1992 recession the Washington office market never
experienced negative absorption, which allowed for a quicker recovery. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Washington, D.C. area also benefits from
one of the best overall transportation systems in the country. The Washington MetroRail
System is among the most efficient and convenient in the world, providing excellent
service to major parts of Suburban Maryland, Northern Virginia and the District of
Columbia offering a viable alternative to roadway travel. The construction of the
MetroRail has spurred new development in downtown Washington and its suburbs with major
new office and mixed-use projects being built around the individual Metro stops that have
had a major impact on land values around each station. In particular, former lesser
desirable portions of downtown Washington and Arlington County have experienced economic
revitalization due to the opening of MetroRail.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Washington area is served by three major
airports: Washington National, Washington Dulles International, and Baltimore/Washington
International(BWI). Together these airports make the area the fourth largest travel market
in the nation. The primary road network is comprised of Interstates 495, 395, 295, 95,
270, and 66; U.S. Routes 50, 29, and 1; Virginia Routes 267 (Dulles Toll Road), 123, and
7; and, the George Washington and Baltimore/Washington Parkways.</font></p>
