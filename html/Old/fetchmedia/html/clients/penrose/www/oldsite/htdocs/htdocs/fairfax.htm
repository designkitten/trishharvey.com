<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County, Virginia</font></u></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County is located in the
northeastern corner of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is a suburban county with its
northern edge directly across the Potomac river from both the western tip of Washington,
D.C. and southern portion of Montgomery County, Maryland. Its eastern edge wraps around
Virginia's Arlington County and city of Alexandria and is situated across the Potomac
River from Prince George&#146;s County, Maryland. The County&#146;s western edge is
comprised of the Virginia counties of Loudoun County to the northwest and Prince William
County to the southwest. Historically, the County has evolved from an agricultural area,
to a low-density suburban development to a high density commercial and residential
development in the mid to late 1980's. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County remains Virginia&#146;s most
populous county. The population is projected to increase to 941,500 by the end of century
and to exceed over 1 million by 2010. Approximately 95% percent of Fairfax County
residents are high school graduates and more than 57% of County residents have completed
four years of college or more. More than 51% of employed residents work in the County and
that figure is projected to increase to 56% by 2010.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County is the headquarters of four
Fortune 500 companies: Freddie Mac, General Dynamics, Lafarge and Mobil Oil, and has more
than 100 international firms - the highest in the region. Fairfax County has one of the
lowest unemployment rates in the area at 2.8%. The diversified business base consists of
high technology services, corporate and regional headquarters, trade and professional
associations, business services, and financial service firms. The County is a leader in
fiber optics, telecommunications, and information technology. The County&#146;s proximity
to Washington, D.C. has helped the area to become one of the largest concentrations of
government contractors in the nation. Businesses locate in Fairfax County because of its
highly trained and educated work-force, desirable quality of life, competitive tax
structure and proximity to Washington, D.C. and Washington Dulles International Airport.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County has the largest commercial
office market in Virginia.&nbsp; While Tysons Corner is considered the downtown of Fairfax
County and remains its largest business center with over 20 million square feet of office
space, other areas of the county are rapidly emerging as major business centers as well.
They include the Reston-Herndon Dulles Corridor, Fairfax Center, and Merrifield.</font></p>
