<p><font face="MS Sans Serif"><u><b>Baltimore, MD Metropolitan Area</b></u> </font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Baltimore Primary Metropolitan Statistical Area consists
of Baltimore City and the surrounding counties of Baltimore, Anne Arundel, Carroll,
Harford, Howard and Queen Anne&#146;s. This PMSA has a population of approximately 2.5
million residents, ranking 14th among U.S. cities in population. As noted, it is included
in the MSA of Washington D.C., which is ranked 4th. While Baltimore City has a demographic
profile typical of major U.S. cities, Baltimore County, which surrounds the city and is
home to many of those employed in the city, has a well educated workforce with a large
percentage of professionals. Some 78% of the population have a high school education and
25% have bachelor degrees or higher. The county also boasts household income of $50,452
versus the national average of $45,937. Like most U.S. cities, Baltimore City has suffered
a gradual loss of residents during the past 20 years but the PMSA is forecast to grow
steadily, if moderately, over the next 20 years. At the same time, 1996 was the first year
in recent history in which the number of jobs in the city actually grew, with some
observers anticipating this to be the beginning of an extended period of job growth within
the city.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Baltimore has a well established and modem transportation
infrastructure. The city sits astride I-95 and serves as the commercial hub of I-70,
I-83,1-395, I-695 and U.S. 1. Baltimore-Washington International Airport (BWI) is situated
10 miles from the central business district and is served by 46 scheduled passenger and
cargo carriers. On an average day, some 600 passenger flights utilize the airport.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Baltimore has extensive freight and passenger rail service.
CSX Transportation, Conrail and the Canton Railroad are major freight carriers. Amtrak,
the Amtrak Metroliner service and the MARC Commuter Rail system all provide passenger
service to the city and region. Likewise commuters to and from the downtown area are
served by both the subway system and a new light rail system.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">The Port of Baltimore is a leading U.S. automobile port.
More than 50 steamship lines serve 300 ports nationwide. In recent years the commercial
viability of the port area has been enhanced by the establishment of a State Enterprise
Zone.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">From the standpoint of quality of life, Baltimore is a city
rich in history, cultural activities and recreation. Incorporated in 1797, this will be
the year of its bicentennial celebration. Attractions include Camden Yards, the National
Aquarium, Fort McHenry, the Walters Art Gallery, the Baltimore Museum, the Peabody
Conservatory and the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra. There are approximately 30 colleges
located in the Baltimore metro area.</font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">Baltimore County is home to six Fortune 500 firms and a
variety of other national firms including: Allied Signal, AT&amp;T, Baltimore Gas &amp;
Electric, Bell Atlantic, Bethlehem Steel, Black &amp; Decker, Lockheed Martin, McCormick
&amp; Co. Inc., MCI Telecommunications, Procter &amp; Gamble, and T. Rowe Price. Even with
such a &#145;who&#146;s who&#146; of large firm the region is also home to a large number
of small and midsize firms. Additionally, a significant economic contribution is made by
Federal government agencies located around Washington D.C. which are employers of many
Baltimore's residents.&nbsp; </font></p>

<p><font face="MS Sans Serif">In short, the Washington-Baltimore region has been one of
the national leaders in terms of population and economic growth. Notwithstanding slower
growth in federal government spending, the area benefits from virtually all the essential
ingredients necessary to a sustained, above average rate of economic growth over the
medium and long term.</font></p>
