<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong><u><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County, Virginia</font></u></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County is located in the
northeastern corner of the Commonwealth of Virginia. It is a suburban county with its
northern edge directly across the Potomac river from both the western tip of Washington,
D.C. and southern portion of Montgomery County, Maryland. Its eastern edge wraps around
Virginia's Arlington County and city of Alexandria and is situated across the Potomac
River from Prince George&#146;s County, Maryland. The County&#146;s western edge is
comprised of the Virginia counties of Loudoun County to the northwest and Prince William
County to the southwest. Historically, the County has evolved from an agricultural area,
to a low-density suburban development to a high density commercial and residential
development in the mid to late 1980's. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County remains Virginia&#146;s most
populous county with 879,530 residents in 1995, up 7.41% from 1990. The population is
projected to increase to 941,500 by the end of century and to exceed over 1 million by
2010. Approximately 95% percent of Fairfax County residents are high school graduates and
more than 57% of County residents have completed four years of college or more. More than
51% of employed residents work in the County and that figure is projected to increase to
56% by 2010.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County is the headquarters of four
Fortune 500 companies: Freddie Mac, General Dynamics, Lafarge and Mobil Oil, and has more
than 100 international firms - the highest in the region. Fairfax County has one of the
lowest unemployment rates in the area at 2.8%. The diversified business base consists of
high technology services, corporate and regional headquarters, trade and professional
associations, business services, and financial service firms. The County is a leader in
fiber optics, telecommunications, and information technology. The County&#146;s proximity
to Washington, D.C. has helped the area to become one of the largest concentrations of
government contractors in the nation. More than 650 County firms received nearly $3.5
billion in defense prime contracts in federal fiscal year 1994. Businesses locate in
Fairfax County because of its highly trained and educated work-force, desirable quality of
life, competitive tax structure and proximity to Washington, D.C. and Washington Dulles
International Airport.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">Fairfax County has the largest commercial
office market in Virginia with over 65 million square feet of office space. At the end of
the fourth quarter of 1996, the vacancy rate was down to 5.68%. This was down from 8.5%
and 9.9% for the years ending 1995 and 1994, respectively. While Tysons Corner is
considered the downtown of Fairfax County and remains its largest business center with
over 19 million square feet of office space, other areas of the county are rapidly
emerging as major business centers as well. They include the Reston-Herndon Dulles
Corridor, Fairfax Center, and Merrifield.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font face="MS Sans Serif">In Fairfax County and its constituent
sub-markets, the vacancy rate continues to fall. Rental rates have risen, tenant
concessions have fallen and build to suit projects are currently under way. With net
absorption at over 1 million square feet a year - speculative development in the County
seems to be just around the corner.</font></p>
