  <h3>Mom's Bread </h3>
  <p><span class="dropcap">T</span>his recipe was dictated to me one Saturday night over two thousand miles of copper telephone line.  The comments are all my Mother's original words.  In keeping with the spirit of this retelling the title of the recipe hasn't been changed to reflect my own relationship with my Mother's Mother. </p>
  <p align="center"><em> one package active dry yeast<br />
one cup granulated sugar<br />
one quarter cup warm water<br />
one cup warm cow's milk<br />
one half cup softened butter<br />
two teaspoons salt<br />
three and one half cups flour<br />
one cup roasted, salted Sunflower Seeds<br />
one egg, lightly beaten</em></p>
  <p> Mix the yeast and a spoon of sugar with the water until cloudy. Then add the milk, salt, half each of the sugar and butter. Mix in the flour then place dough on a floured table and knead until smooth. Roll the dough into a ball and butter all around. Set covered in a warm corner until the ball has doubled in size.</p>
  <p> Combine the remaining butter, Sunflower Seeds and sugar. Then knead into the dough. Allow to double again and brush with the egg. Bake in oven at 375 <em>f.</em> until the crust has browned. </p>
