      <h3>Another Summer </h3>
      <div class="asbackground">
        <p> <span class="dropcap">O</span>ur memories being less than sincere, the faded details are forgotten. We  floated past the sun drenched porches and through backyards to fields of  flowing sunflowers where we would chase each other in games of glorious childhood abandon. </p>
        <p>The linoleum in my mother's kitchen glows a brilliant white.   Our kitchen has only recently been coated in white linoleum by my  father and already I've forgotten what the kitchen used to look like. I  sit for hours on the faded lime green carpeted floor of the living room  studying black and white pictures of unknown people living in our house. I study a photograph of my father's mother. I look deep into the photo, past my grandmother to    the faded scene behind her, for clues to what the kitchen used to look like. </p>
        <p>The pictures are kept in a white plastic Tupperware container that has somehow lost its original use of keeping leftovers fresh in the refridgerator.   Like the photographs it captures <a href="history.html">history</a> and holds them waiting for someone to unlock their secrets.  </p>
        <p>My mother is baking bread from my <a href="grandma.html">Grandmother's</a> <a href="recipe.html">recipe</a>. The smell of the bread is warm and comfortable like a goose down comforter. I watch as she  moves through the kitchen just as perfectly as a prima-ballerina.      </p>
        <p>My father sits in a corner of the kitchen quietly watching the scene play itself out in front of him.  That's how my father is, it doesn't seem like he's involved in the world.  He is only an observer sipping slowly from a glass of coke and rye whiskey. I can't help thinking that one day I'll look over to the corner and he won't be there.</p>
